ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Satchel Peterson
________________________________
I am a third year at Columbia University studying Computer Science 
with a lifelong background as a musician. After many years of engagement on this front, 
I decided to merge the leadership, creative, and performance skills I've obtained with my 
tech driven side. Currently, I'm interested in creating engaging user experiences, building 
informative and interactive data-driven models, and finding imaginative solutions to problems.
During my remaining time in school I'm eager to explore these interests further while learning 
more tools, languages, and skills. In the future I hope to experience life as a software 
engineer in the industry, build a start-up that will combine my passion of music with computer
science, and incorporate electronic music/live coding into my live performances.
